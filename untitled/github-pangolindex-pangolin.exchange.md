# GitHub - pangolindex/pangolin.exchange

This is the code for the pangolin.exchange website.

The app's smart contract code can be found [here](http://github.com/pangolindex/exchange-contracts).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies

```text
yarn install
```

Then, start the development server

```text
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to see the result.

The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Building for Production

Generate the production build

```text
yarn build
```

This exports a static site into the `build` directory.

You can then serve this anyway you'd like \(Cloudflare workers, Netlify, etc.\).
